## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Wouter** for routing
- **TanStack Query** for state management
- **Radix UI** components with shadcn/ui
- **Vite** for build tooling

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **TypeScript** with ESM modules
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM
- **Express Sessions** for authentication

### APIs & Services
- **Spotify Web API** for music data and playlist management
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4) for intelligent playlist generation
- **OAuth 2.0** for secure Spotify authentication

### Backend / API Flow
1. **Pull playlist data** using the Spotify API to get track IDs along with
   metadata and existing audio features.
2. **Analyze tracks** via Spotify's `/audio-features` endpoint to obtain BPM,
   energy, valence, danceability, instrumentalness and other metrics.
3. **Modify the playlist** based on the user's prompt:
   - Remove songs outside the desired mood, genre, year or BPM range
   - Reorder or group tracks
   - Replace tracks with similar recommendations that match the target vibe
   - Expand the playlist with additional matching songs
4. **Return** the updated playlist object or create the modified playlist
   directly in the user's Spotify library.

## Getting Started

The project is a typical Node + React monorepo. If you just want to try it out,
follow the quick start below. For a more detailed guide, see the full
instructions that follow.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptify.git
cd promptify
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in Spotify and OpenAI keys
npm run db:push        # set up the database
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5000> in your browser and sign in with Spotify.

Follow the steps below if you need more explanation or are setting up for
development.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **PostgreSQL** (local or remote instance)
- **Spotify Developer account** for OAuth credentials
- **OpenAI API key** for playlist generation

### 2. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptify.git
cd promptify
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in the values:
   - `DATABASE_URL` â€“ connection string to your PostgreSQL database
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` â€“ from the Spotify
     Developer Dashboard
   - `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` â€“ OAuth callback URL
   - Either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY_ENV_VAR` must provide your OpenAI API key (the app will fail to start if neither is set)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` â€“ any random string
   - You can also provide the OpenAI key later from the Preferences panel in the web UI

### 4. Database Setup

Run the migrations to create the required tables:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 5. Start the App

Launch the development server which runs both the API and the React client:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5000> in your browser and you should see Promptify.

### Spotify App Setup
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/spotify/callback`
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

## Usage

1. Connect your Spotify account
2. Enter a natural language prompt describing your desired playlist
3. Optionally adjust advanced settings (mood, energy, tempo, etc.)
4. Generate your playlist
5. Save it directly to your Spotify library

### Example Prompts
- "Create a chill study playlist with lo-fi beats and ambient sounds"
- "I need epic workout music with heavy bass and high energy"
- "Make me a nostalgic 90s road trip playlist"
- "Dark villain origin story vibes with haunting melodies"
