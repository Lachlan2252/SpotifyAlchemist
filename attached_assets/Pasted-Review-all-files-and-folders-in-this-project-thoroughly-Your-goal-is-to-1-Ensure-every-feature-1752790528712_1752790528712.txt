Review all files and folders in this project thoroughly.

Your goal is to:
1. Ensure **every feature described in prompts, documentation, or code** is properly implemented, fully functional, and connected to the app.
2. Identify and **fix any bugs**, broken functions, undefined variables, or unused components.
3. Make sure **every feature has a place in the UI** — nothing should be implemented in the backend or logic without a frontend control, display, or button.
4. Check that all **backend functions have proper routes, handlers, and responses**.
5. Make sure frontend and backend are **fully connected** — endpoints used in the frontend actually exist and respond correctly.
6. Validate all logic for Spotify API usage — especially:
   - Recommendations
   - Audio features
   - Seed handling
   - Track filtering
   - Playlist creation
7. Ensure **prompt parsing is reliable** and maps cleanly to Spotify parameters.
8. Fix UI bugs or inconsistencies — buttons that don’t trigger anything, missing states, layout issues, or outdated components.
9. Check for redundant or unused code and remove it.
10. Check that **all async functions are awaited** and API calls are properly handled with error catching.
11. Confirm proper use of Spotify OAuth and token refresh flow.
12. Identify any **missing or incomplete** features mentioned in past prompts or TODOs in code, and implement them if possible.

After reviewing, fix all found issues and refactor or update any part of the app that doesn’t meet these criteria.

This includes reviewing:
- All React frontend components
- API handlers and utility functions
- Spotify service and OpenAI service code
- Prompt parsing logic
- Playlist filtering logic
- Any router or server logic
- User authentication flows
- CSS/styling integration and responsiveness
- .env usage and variable mapping

Then test the full user flow:
- Prompt → AI → Playlist generation → Spotify creation → Display → Edits
- Editing existing playlists with smart filtering
- Display of generated or edited playlists in the UI
- Error and edge-case handling (e.g., zero results, invalid prompt, auth failure)

Once the full pass is done, ensure the app runs cleanly with:
- No console errors
- No 404 or 500s from any endpoint
- All prompts generating matching, on-theme playlists
- All generated playlists enforce filters and mood settings
- All playlist mods work and reflect in Spotify and UI

Output a short summary of the changes and confirmed fixes after the full pass is complete.
