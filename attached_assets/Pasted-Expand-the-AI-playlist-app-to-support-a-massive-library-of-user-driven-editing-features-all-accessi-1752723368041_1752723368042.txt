Expand the AI playlist app to support a massive library of user-driven editing features, all accessible through natural language commands or prompt-style input. The AI should intelligently interpret commands like “Make this playlist feel older,” “Swap sad tracks for aggressive ones,” or “Sort by tempo then genre.” Include tools for emotional tuning, timeline remixing, rarity hunting, culture-matching, and cross-platform inspiration.
